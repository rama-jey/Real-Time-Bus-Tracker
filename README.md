# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

# Description:
This project is to track the movement of the bus in real time. I used the API key from radar.com to fetch and display the map, set up latitude and longitude points for the bus stops and wrote a move funtion to make the map pointer move and stop on all those points (bus stops). 

# How to Run: 
Download all the files (HTML, CSS and JS) and open the HTML file in your Chrome browser (recommended). Once the window is loaded, you can see the map pointer moves and stops on all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. 

# Roadmap of future improvements:
I can draw a path of the pointer that moves from the starting point to the ending point.
